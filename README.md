# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

A machine learning project that predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset. The project follows a complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, visualization, model training with Linear Regression, and model deployment using Pickle.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
- Model Training with Linear Regression
- Evaluation using RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE
- Model Serialization for deployment
